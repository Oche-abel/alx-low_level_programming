A singly linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing a data element and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the head, and the last node points to null. Singly linked lists are used to store and manipulate collections of data in computer science and programming. They are easy to traverse in one direction, from the head to the end, and can be dynamically resized by adding or removing nodes. However, accessing nodes in the middle of the list or searching for a specific element can be slower than in other data structures, such as arrays or binary search trees.
